# ARIMA-TS-Forecast-For-Energy-Production

Analyses was done in a Jupyter notebook file and data is housed in the data folder.

This is a time series forecast of US energy production using a seasonal ARIMA model with some data visualisations. Visualisations were done using plotly and matplotlib. Plotly visualisations might have not appear on Github without an account.

Model only works on univariate problems, so I'll be looking to work on multivariate solutions.
